# TicTacToe A.I

The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game made using C++. The game is played on the terminal and the user needs to enter the position values only. Beware, unbeatable opponent!

In this code, I've used minimax algorithm to help the computer where to go for the next move and win the puzzle.

Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.

### Instructions to run:
#### Windows
1. Install a cpp compiler
2. Open commmand prompt in the folder where program is saved
3. `g++ main.cpp` then `./a`

#### Linux
1. Install a cpp compiler
2. Open terminal in the folder where program is saved
3. `g++ main.cpp` then `./a.out`
